# COLOUR KEYLESS TRANSMISSION

The concept eliminates the mathematical approaches for the encryption method and approaches towards the Machine Language Model which works on randomized Match

In Regular Today we can't understand what other country people talks when we don't know their language and when we hear it feels so random

In the Same way Two Machine cannot intercept each other if they have two different Language to communicate with each other.

But if they Learn to speak with each other They can talk with each other and Machine can have Uncountable language which he can create with himself and can teach other machine to communicate.

This Is Just The Basic Layout Approach of the Idea Just To Prove the point for further Project.

We will be making many keyless transmission studies and implement it from now.

# Smart Homes are Coming and Smart Machine Family System is Needed.

Go through 

temp.js 

I have given an overview of the project over there.

# Further Updates

I will create a chat application to demonstrate the full process and try to attack the machines with different approach to decrypt the messege he is trying to send.

We follow the Small World Network Approach to Solve all the Problems we encounter Anywhere As the model is like Virus Spreading But It follows like Whatever Goes Around Comes Around..ðŸª¦
