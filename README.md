# (AlphaChanger) COLOUR KEYLESS TRANSMISSION

The concept eliminates the mathematical approaches for the encryption method and approaches towards the Machine Language Model which works on randomized Match

In Regular Today we can't understand what other country people talks when we don't know their language and when we hear it feels so random

In the Same way Two Machine cannot intercept each other if they have two different Language to communicate with each other.

But if they Learn to speak with each other They can talk with each other and Machine can have Uncountable language which he can create with himself and can teach other machine to communicate.

This Is Just The Basic Layout Approach of the Idea Just To Prove the point for further Project.

We will be making many keyless transmission studies and implement it from now.

# Smart Homes are Coming and Smart Machine Family System is Needed.

Go through 

temp.js 

I have given an overview of the project over there.

# Further Updates

I will create a chat application to demonstrate the full process and try to attack the machines with different approach to decrypt the messege he is trying to send.

We follow the Small World Network Approach to Solve all the Problems we encounter Anywhere As the model is like Virus Spreading But It follows like Whatever Goes Around Comes Around..ðŸª¦

# Process Explained

Initial Phase::(DAY1)(Of Release) Two Friends who meet each other wants to messege each other.

They will share their QR code which has Language Book.

Both Learns The Language.

And Now Whatever You Speak will be your Common Language which only you two know.

Now bring small world network which means every person is within the proximity of 4-6 link away.

If everywhere people connect with atleast between two.

If someone is common Link betweeen two new Machine The will get a public Language Code which is in common Machine Language and as both the Machine knows the language of Middle Common Machine in which it speaks with them it will send the code in its language to both which is also not decryptable.

Now as we have a public Language Code in both side We are using our app Authenticator Part which has a hard coded language for many language and as both Machine have same Language Book Dictionary and will get same Language Book they will talk with that book for some time and Come out with their own Language Book to Communicate with Each Other.

Now We have Connected One more member and So goes On With the Help of Small World Network system.

As we have synonyms in our language for every word Machine will also have synonyms So that even if it tries to serve you food you will think he said you to sleep instead.

----------------------------------------------

This is just a simple overview of the idea to introduce the Concept while the original idea is more complex then this and Uses More Complexion.

I have tried to Make the simple model to express my concerns for a new approach.

----------------------------------------------

Our Personal Life is invaded always because of the classifiers in our datas which we send over internet maybe if you want to know the pros and cons we can see it for ourselves now.

Before we didn't had internet when we used simple techniques for encryption but now we have availability of internet and Social Medias are the best example for small world networks so we don't have to worry there is millions of possibilities for this kind of communication.

I believe Web3 gave us the autonomous system but I also would like to express the Next Gen Will be Web3ServerMachineRandomization (Possibilties)
